# ðŸŒ³ National Parks Digital Passport ðŸŒ³

## App Story

Since 1986, national park visitors have used the Passport To Your National ParksÂ® program to preserve memories of their park travels, collecting ink stamps at every park they visit. These rubber stamps are fun to collect and are a great way to remember a trip to one of America's beautiful National Parks. However, it can be hard to remember to pack the passport for your trip and to get a stamp when you're at the park. Plus, what happens if your passport is lost, stolen, or destroyed by the elements?

The NPS Digital Passport is a way to ensure that no matter when you visit a park, you're able to record the memory forever in a virtual book. The app provides users with a colorful, beautiful, and special way to preserve their log of each park that they've visited, mark bucket list locations they want to see, and leave reviews of their favorite parks.
